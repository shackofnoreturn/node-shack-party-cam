# Node Party Cam
Super awesome party picture app on your local network!
Let your visitors take pictures and present them on a main screen for a ton of laughs and at the same time keeping the embaressing pics as an inside joke, not an internet wide mistake ;)

## How to run

Navigate to the root directory and run the command below.
This will start the backend and host the frontend in the "public" folder.

```bash
node server.js
```

You'll see the console reporting the port where it's listening for incoming data. Go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
